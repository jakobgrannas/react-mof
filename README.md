Test MultiOptionFilter "app" with React.js
===============

A PoC I made for a Hackathon at [Vaimo](http://www.vaimo.com)

### How to run it
First, make sure you clone the repo to somewhere where MAMP/your web server can reach it.

``` npm install ```

then 

```npm start ```

The app should now be running on your localhost.
